Write a C++ program that removes a specific word from a given string. Return the new string. 



#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;
string test(std::string s, std::string w)
{
       while (s.find(w) != string::npos)
        s.replace(s.find(w), w.length(), "");
        return s;
}
int main()
{
	string text = "Exercises Practice Solution";
	string word ="Solution";
	cout << "String: " << text;
	cout << "\nWord to remove: " << word;
	cout << "\nNew string, after removing the said word:\n";
	cout << test(text, word) << endl;
    word ="Practice";
	cout << "\nString: " << text;
	cout << "\nWord to remove: " << word;
	cout << "\nNew string, after removing the said word:\n";
	cout << test(text, word) << endl;
	word ="Exercises";
	cout << "\nString: " << text;
	cout << "\nWord to remove: " << word;
	cout << "\nNew string, after removing the said word:\n";
	cout << test(text, word) << endl; 	  	 
}
